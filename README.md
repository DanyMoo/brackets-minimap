:heavy_exclamation_mark: **This extension is no longer supported.  It may be rewritten when/if Brackets gets to a more finalized state.  In the meantime I would suggest Sublime Text 3 as a good alternative editor with a minimap.**

A minimap extension for the <a href="http://www.brackets.io">Brackets</a> open-source code editor.

![minimap](https://raw.github.com/websiteduck/brackets-wdminimap/master/brackets-wdminimap.png)

To show or hide the minimap, in the top menu click View > Show Minimap.

To switch between plain text or CodeMirror (syntax highlighting), use the right-click context menu of the minimap.
